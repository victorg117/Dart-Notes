Dart Notes 4 -- Null Safety

Null Safety implies that null values cannot exist in places where they are not supposed to exist

What is SOUND Null Safety?
    - If the type system determines that something is not null, that thing can NEVER be null
        - Smaller binaries, faster execution
    
    - Types in your code are non-nullable by default
        - Variables cannot contain null, unless you say they can

    - Runtime null errors turn into edit-time analysis errrors
        - The faster you observe an issue, the faster you can solve it
    
    - Null will still exist in every Dart program
        - It simply won't exist in places it shouldn'take

    - Everything in DART is an object
        - These objects are instances of different classes
        - Types are also classes from which objects can be instantiated from

    - Before Null Safety --> Null was a subclass of every other class
    
    - Now, null is not a subclass of any class --> thus the only type that permitts a null value is type null

    - Postfix var assignments with ? allow null values:
        String?
        int?
        double?
        --> Can all be null
